<h3>What is OpenStack ?</h3>
<p>OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure.</p>
<h3>What is Kubernetes ?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
<p>It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.</p>

<h3>Deploying Kubernetes on OpenStack</h3>
<p>Once you have OpenStack environment configured, deploying OpenShift will be done using a simple three-step phased approach.</p>

<li><b>Step 1:</b> Deploy k8s Infrastructure using Heat and Ansible.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Install k8s using Ansible.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Configure k8s and additional services using Ansible.</li>
